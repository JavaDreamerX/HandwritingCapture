# HandwritingCapture
Captures Handwriting Digital Ink and Saves as Image for Download
  
This Software is a Derivative of the Kanji Canvas Example Website. I had it modified to save the input as an image rather than just parse it.

# Why do I need samples?
I need samples of Handwritten Japanese characters in order to train a nueral network for my educational game that I am having developed that teaches Japanese.
